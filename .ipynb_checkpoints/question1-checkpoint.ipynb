    "b.Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and packages for tasks ranging from web development to data analysis,\n",
    "making it suitable for a wide variety of applications without needing third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Dynamically Typed and Interpreted: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variables before using them, and it is interpreted, \n",
    "which allows for quick development cycles and easy debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Cross-platform: Python is available on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) which ensures that code written \n",
    "in Python can run seamlessly on these platforms without modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.Large Community and Support: Python has a vast community of users who contribute \n",
    "to its ecosystem with libraries, frameworks, and modules. This community also provides extensive documentation and support through forums and websites.\n",
